FUTURE WORK:
* better balancing when removing/inserting elements from/to btree -- right now, it always inserts/removes from the left subtree. This may cause the tree to be left-heavy, which is especially bad since the left side contains the smallest-sized memblocks, which will presumably be allocated more frequently than the larger-sized blocks (not sure if this is necessarily true, however -- just my intuition).
