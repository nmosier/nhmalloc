* change memblock_t from btree_t to btree_t *
* finished implementing btree_remove

//

* need to maintain two different sturctures: one for FREE -> store in bintree; one for USED -> store in list?
* or just use a separate field to store whehter tree contains free item


/////
actually, implement bintree + linked list system.
* btree holds only free blocks
* linked list holds everything, but only needs to be minimal
e.g. size & prevsize
* it should then be easy to allocate & merge togethex
